# Project Rules

## Writing Style (Super Important)

This project has a specific vibe for how we write stuff. Whether its docs, comments, or commit messages.

**The goal is to sound human, not like ChatGPT wrote it**

What to avoid

- Dont use colons everywhere like "Feature: Description here"
- No em dashes that look robotic
- Skip the perfectly structured bullet points with parallel grammar
- Dont overexplain obvious stuff
- No "This function does X" type comments that just repeat the code

What to do instead

- Write like youre explaining to a friend
- Use contractions (dont, wont, cant, its)
- Slang is fine (gonna, kinda, tbh, ngl, btw)
- Sentences can be fragments sometimes. Thats ok
- Mix short and long sentences naturally
- Typos are not the end of the world

## Code Comments

Comments should feel like a human wrote them real quick, not generated by AI

**Bad example (too AI)**

```javascript
// This function fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API
// Parameters: city (string) - the name of the city to fetch weather for
// Returns: Promise<Object> - the weather data object
async function fetchWeather(city) {
```

**Good example (human vibes)**

```javascript
// grab weather data for whatever city user typed in
async function fetchWeather(city) {
```

More examples of good comments

```javascript
// cache this so we dont spam the API
localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(data))

// idk why the API returns temp in kelvin by default, we force metric
const url = `${BASE_URL}?units=metric`

// user probably fat fingered the city name
if (!response.ok) {
   showError("couldnt find that city, check spelling?")
}

// TODO: add loading spinner here, blank screen looks broken
```

## Naming Conventions

**Variables and functions**
Use camelCase. Keep names short but descriptive enough.

```javascript
// good
const cityName = "Jakarta"
const weatherData = {}
function updateUI() {}
function showError() {}

// not great (too long)
const currentlySelectedCityNameFromInput = "Jakarta"
function updateTheWeatherDisplayWithNewData() {}

// also not great (too short, confusing)
const cn = "Jakarta"
function upd() {}
```

**CSS classes**
Lowercase with hyphens. Nothing fancy.

```css
.weather-card {}
.search-form {}
.error-message {}
.is-hidden {}
.is-loading {}
```

**File names**
All lowercase. Use hyphens if needed.

- styles.css
- app.js
- weather-icons.svg

## Dos and Donts

### Do these things

Write semantic HTML. Use header, main, section, not divs for everything.

Keep functions small. If a function is doing 5 different things, break it up.

Handle errors properly. Every fetch needs a try catch.

Cache API responses. Dont hit the API on every single action.

Test on mobile. Open devtools, resize to phone size, make sure nothing breaks.

Use CSS variables for colors. Makes it easy to adjust the theme later.

Comment the weird stuff. If code looks confusing, explain why its like that.

### Dont do these things

Dont use alert() for errors. Its ugly and old school.

Dont leave console.logs everywhere. Clean them up before committing.

Dont ignore loading states. Users shouldnt stare at blank screens.

Dont hardcode the API key in plain sight without at least a comment acknowledging it.

Dont write CSS thats 500 lines of random selectors. Organize it.

Dont forget the return statement after early error checks.

## Error Handling Guidelines

Every API call wrapped in try catch. No exceptions.

```javascript
// always do this pattern
async function getData() {
   try {
      const res = await fetch(url)
      if (!res.ok) throw new Error("API said no")
      return await res.json()
   } catch (err) {
      // do something useful, dont just console.log and move on
      showError("something went wrong, try again")
      return null
   }
}
```

User friendly messages only. Never show technical errors to user.

```javascript
// bad
showError(error.message) // might show "TypeError: Cannot read property..."

// good  
showError("couldnt load weather, check your connection")
```

Always have a fallback. If fetch fails, show cached data if available.

## If Writing in Indonesian

Kalo disuruh nulis pake bahasa Indo, jangan translate dari English. Tulis langsung pake gaya Indo yang natural.

**Yang salah (terjemahan kaku)**

```javascript
// Fungsi ini mengambil data cuaca dari API
// Mengembalikan objek data cuaca
```

**Yang bener (Indo natural campur English)**

```javascript
// ambil data cuaca dari api, simpen ke state
// kalo gagal ya udah pake cache aja
```

Boleh campur English buat istilah teknis

```javascript
// fetch data, terus update DOM nya
// caching biar ga boros API call
```

## Git Commits

Keep it short and casual. No need for conventional commits format.

```
// good
fix search not working on enter key
add loading state when fetching
style the error message box

// not needed for this project
feat(search): implement city search functionality with debounce
```

## When Stuck

If something isnt working and youve been debugging for 30+ mins

1. Take a break, seriously
2. Reread the requirements, maybe you misunderstood something
3. Check the browser console, the error is usually there
4. Google the exact error message
5. Simplify the code to the bare minimum and add back piece by piece

Dont be afraid to delete code and start that section fresh. Sometimes thats faster than fixing spaghetti.
